# pandas-challenge

## Background
You are the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. Your role involves helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 

Your first task is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You have been provided with access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your objective is to aggregate the data and identify trends in school performance.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository called "pandas-challenge" for this project.
2. Clone the repository to your local computer.
3. Inside the repository, create a folder named "PyCitySchools" for this assignment.
4. Place your Jupyter notebook in the "PyCitySchools" folder. This notebook will be used for analysis.
5. Push your changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Report Requirements

### District Summary
- Calculate and present key metrics for the entire district in a DataFrame.
- Metrics to include:
  - Total number of unique schools
  - Total number of students
  - Total budget
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - Percentage of students passing math
  - Percentage of students passing reading
  - Percentage of students passing both math and reading

### School Summary
- Calculate and present key metrics for each school in a DataFrame.
- Metrics to include:
  - School name
  - School type
  - Total number of students
  - Total school budget
  - Budget per student
  - Average math score
  - Average reading score
  - Percentage of students passing math
  - Percentage of students passing reading
  - Percentage of students passing both math and reading

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Sort the schools by percentage of overall passing students in descending order.
- Display the top 5 performing schools in a DataFrame named "top_schools".

### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Sort the schools by percentage of overall passing students in ascending order.
- Display the bottom 5 performing schools in a DataFrame named "bottom_schools".

### Math Scores by Grade
- Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade
- Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending
- Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
- Use the provided code to create spending bins and labels.
- Calculate the mean scores and passing percentages for each spending range.
- Create a DataFrame named "spending_summary" to display the results.

### Scores by School Size
- Categorize schools based on their size (small, medium, or large) using the provided code.
- Create a DataFrame named "size_summary" to display the average scores and passing percentages for each school size category.

### Scores by School Type
- Create a DataFrame named "type_summary" to display the average scores and passing percentages for each school type.

## Observable Trends
Provide a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data analysis.
